Everyday millions of frequent flyer miles expire. Miles have been proven to be a valuable currency - there are endless possibilities when it comes to earning and redeeming. However, most miles expire and the airlines usually won’t notify the customer. MileageTracker manages miles across all airlines in one place. Our solution syncs all of the user’s miles and displays the balances with expiration dates in their online dashboard. The user is able to glance at all of their miles in one place, including information on when they expire. Custom alerts can be set to notify when miles expire by email or SMS text message.
